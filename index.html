        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Brianda Avila, I am fluent in both English and Spanish. Both my parents immigrated from Mexico and I have three younger sisters. I currently reside in Riverside, CA but I was raised in San Diego. I attended San Diego High School and graduated as an honor roll student in 2019. I am a first generation student at the University of California Riverside. I am a third year undergraduate student majoring in Anthropology. I am minoring in Business with a concentration in Marketing.

<br><br>

      During high school I was in a medical academy, it exposed students to different jobs in the medical field. Being in this program allowed me to work along with other people in the medical field, although I am not pursuing a career in the medical field I was able to make strong connections. I was able to work with the medical school staff at the University of California San Diego, they guided us through a four week research topic picked and conducted by us. We shadowed the medical staff at the Naval medical Center in San Diego. I also attended many seminars based around STEM Cell research. We partnered up with a biomedical company and spent the day working with the staff in order to come up with new and efficient biomedical gadgets. We planned out what we wanted to focus on, then worked on the structure of the invention, and after presented it in front of potential customers. 
<br><br>

       After graduating high school I did a six week internship with Kaiser Permanente where I shadowed a nurse educator. I was located in the ICU unit where I observed staff from different positions. I was put with doctors, nurses, medical billing staff, and human resources staff just to name a few. I was able to help my nurse educator plan and conduct the hiring process for traveling nurses. In doing this I developed many skills like typing, inserting data, making copies, and communication skills. I also worked a retail job at my local target. My position was a Beauty Consultant but I would also work as a cashier. This allowed me to develop customer services skills, time management skills, organizational skills, and comprehension skills.
       I would like to be able to work with people to build a growing and safe working environment. I am confident that with my creativity I will be able to help in many aspects of future jobs. I am able to adapt to any work environment and open to learning new skills. I am sure that I will be able to tackle any obstacle alongside my colleagues. I hope to make a positive contribution to any company I work with. I am a quick learner so new tasks do not interfere with my work. I have also built basic computer skills which have allowed me to work fast and efficiently. I have many leadership skills that have and will continue to help me make a change in the workplace.
